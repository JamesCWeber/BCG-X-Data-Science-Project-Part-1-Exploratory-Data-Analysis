# Exploratory Data Analysis (BCG X Data Science Project Part 1)
![Introductory Picture](EDA.png)
## Introduction
This is Part 1 of a project from the [BCG X Data Science micro-internship](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/bcg/data-science-ccdz). The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is an American global consulting firm that  partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges. It is one of the world's 3 largest consulting firms along with McKinsey & Company and Bain & Company. BCG X is a new initiative from BCG that combines the firm's consulting expertise with tech building and design.

In this task, I take on the role of a junior data analyst employed at BCG X. BCG X's client, a major gas and electricity utility called PowerCo, is concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers.

## Problem Statement
PowerCo has expressed concern over their customers leaving them for better offers from competing energy companies. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that the energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from. During a meeting with the Associate Director of the Data Science team, one potential reason for churn is price sensitivity. I am tasked with investigating this hypothesis. To gain a holistic understanding of the data provided by PowerCo, my first task is to conduct exploratory data analysis.
